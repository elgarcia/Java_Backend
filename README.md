# Java_Backend
-------
These are proyects and informative files that I use while Im studying a Java Backend Developer title.

-----
### Part 1
These are some basics projects to learn Java language and logic.

You could check them if you want to learn from the bottom about the programming logic in Java and some basic functions and definitions.

### Part 2
The first part of this 2nd part of the course is a summary of the Part 1.

Once we end the first part we proceed to learn some advanced functions and usages of this language and start to see what **Frameworks** and **Annotations** are.

The next step is about the backend development with Java, using Spring Boot framework.

## SpringNovables

The projects Springnovables and **Web App** are basically the final project of this course where I have to use all the knowledge acquired.

#### The project is divided by two parts.

### Part 1
It consists in develop an **API Rest** app to save and load data using a current **Database**, the target of this first part is to use **JPARepositories** to save objects we make in a real database. Once we have this we have to implement **Services** and **RestControllers** to manage the request the user make to our API.

### Part 2
In this final part what we have to do is to implement a Web App to let the user do **CRUD** opperations to our database. The main target is to make the views with **Thymeleaf** and let them take information from our **DTO** object to correctely pass them to our database and JSON file. 
Here we implement some **Security** classes to authorize users to use some views or not, and finally make the necessary **Controllers** to communicate to our **API Rest** app.

Feel free to explore through the projects and let me know if you want to more information about it.
